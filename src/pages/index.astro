Dress smart-casual, bring cash (RMB) for tips, and learn basic Mandarin phrases like 'hěn hǎo' (very good). Respect no-touch zones, tip generously (10-20%), and exit discreetly. Humidity means light clothing post-session; expats note English menus in top spots. With 0 verified listings here, cross-check Dianping app reviews for authenticity and savor the cultural nuance safely.<\/p>"}];
